"""Wired USB support for the Switch 2 Pro Controller 2 and the NSO GameCube Controller.

A physically-connected pad (USB, VID 0x057E / PID 0x2069 Pro Controller 2 or
PID 0x2073 NSO GameCube Controller) is adapted
into the existing ``Controller`` pipeline the same way the ESP32-S3 serial bridge is
(see ``usb_serial_bridge.ESP32S3Controller``): we subclass ``Controller`` and provide
a small mock "client" that speaks hidapi instead of BLE/GATT.  Because the mock client
exposes the same ``services`` / ``start_notify`` / ``write_gatt_char`` surface the base
class already uses, the whole input pipeline — button/stick parsing, gyro fusion, mouse
emulation, calibration, rumble — is reused unchanged.

Only two things genuinely differ from BLE:

* The SW2 command header carries a *transport* byte (``commands.md`` header offset 2):
  ``0x00`` for USB vs ``0x01`` for Bluetooth.  ``write_command`` is overridden for that.
* Input/commands travel as USB HID reports (report IDs from ``hid_reports.md``) instead
  of GATT notifications, handled by the ``_UsbHidClient`` shim.

Windows note: the vendor command interface (MI_01) is reached through Windows' own
inbox WinUSB driver, which the controller's Microsoft OS descriptor normally makes
Windows bind automatically -- no Zadig, no third-party driver.  Three routes are
tried in order: native WinUSB, pyusb/libusb, then HID output reports on interface 0.

If all three fail the pad never leaves its power-on input mode.  That degrades
rather than dies: the GameCube path re-encodes the power-on report (0x05) into the
same layout its native report (0x0A) produces, so buttons, sticks and both analog
triggers keep working; only motion data is lost.  ``input_transport`` says which
mode is actually live, and it is set from the report id that arrived -- never
inferred from a command write having succeeded.

GameCube rumble follows the same transport priority as startup: a verified vendor
interface is tried first, then a failed or unavailable interface 1 falls back to HID
output report 0x03 on interface 0.  The HID encoding is confirmed from a wire-level
capture of the official console. Pro Controller 2 rumble remains on HID report 0x02.

GameCube notes: the NSO GameCube Controller speaks the very same command framing and
differs only in (a) its input report id (0x0A instead of 0x09), (b) its output report
id (0x03 instead of 0x02), and (c) rumble, which is a plain on/off command rather than
HD rumble frames.  Report 0x0A's payload is byte-for-byte the layout the Bluetooth
GameCube path already parses (``ControllerInputData``'s GameCube branch), so wiring it
up is a transport concern only -- no new parsing.
