"""ESP32 bridge-level rumble dispatcher for merged Joy-Con pairs.

Problem solved here
-------------------
In merged Joy-Con mode (Left + Right pair sharing one ESP32-S3 bridge), each
Joy-Con's input loop independently calls set_vibration() which each write a
separate serial command ("wr 0 r <payload>" and "wr 1 r <payload>").  These
arrive at the firmware at different times; the BLE radio schedules them as two
independent BLE write events.  Because both connections share the same 7.5 ms
radio schedule, they tend to alternate: one Joy-Con fires while the other's BLE
window is closed, and vice versa.  Result: each motor only vibrates at ~30 Hz
and they appear to alternate ("left on, right off" / "right on, left off").

Fix
---
This module provides ESP32BridgeRumbleDispatcher, a bridge-level coordinator
that:
  1. Collects the latest Left / Right payloads via submit_left() / submit_right()
     (called from controller.set_vibration() instead of a direct BLE write).
  2. Runs a single asyncio task ticking at ESP32_BRIDGE_RUMBLE_PAIR_INTERVAL_SEC
     (default 15 ms, ~66 Hz), which is more conservative than the 7.5 ms BLE
     connection interval and avoids flooding the firmware with back-to-back writes.
  3. Sends ONE "wrpair" serial command carrying *different* L and R payloads in
     the same tick, so the firmware processes both in a single command-handling
     cycle and queues both BLE writes together.
  4. Hold-last-nonzero: if one side has no new dirty payload this tick but the
     global rumble is still considered active, it re-sends the last active payload
     so a controller whose input loop fires slightly later does not produce silence.
  5. Global idle zero: only after BOTH sides have been inactive for
     ESP32_BRIDGE_RUMBLE_GLOBAL_ZERO_AFTER_SEC (200 ms) is a final zero sent.
     Per-side auto-zero timers are NOT used — they caused L/R alternation at ~7 Hz.
  6. Per-side explicit stop: if a controller submits a zero payload (is_zero=True
     in its input loop), that side is marked wants_stop and no longer held until a
     new active payload arrives.

A/B test modes (set via CONFIG.esp32_bridge_pair_mode or module constant)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
  "pair"   (default) – wrpair with independent L/R payloads
  "mirror"            – send same L payload to both channels via wrpair
  "single"            – bypass dispatcher entirely; controller writes directly
                        (set in controller.py, never reaches this dispatcher)

Paths NOT affected
------------------
- WinRT BLE path (is_esp32s3_bridge=False) — never reaches this module
- Single Joy-Con on bridge (is_merged=False) — condition not met, old path used
- Pro controller on bridge — uses its own set_vibration() path
- NSO GameCube controller — uses GCN PWM loop, bypasses set_vibration() entirely

# Dispatch interval: 15 ms (~66 Hz).  Two BLE connections sharing one 7.5 ms radio
# can sustain ~66 writes/sec per channel, so this is the practical ceiling for a
# merged pair.  CRITICAL: Windows' default timer granularity is 15.6 ms, which
# makes asyncio.sleep(0.015) frequently overshoot to ~29 ms (the next tick) — only
# ~34 pairs/sec.  At that rate the ~12 ms of samples in each rumble packet leave a
# ~17 ms gap and the motor stutters.  _set_timer_resolution() raises the timer to
# 1 ms so the 15 ms tick is actually honoured (~66/sec), closing the gap.

# guards the abnormal case where a game holds an active rumble then stops sending
# entirely without ever sending a zero.
#
# CRITICAL: this must be LONGER than the real rumble-update spacing, otherwise it
# fires *between* legitimate sparse updates and chops a continuous rumble.  Games
# update rumble as slowly as ~4/s (250 ms apart) — the old 200 ms value was
# shorter than that and force-stopped the motor ~4x/sec (global_zero=3/s in logs),
